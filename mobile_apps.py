\n 9) sqlite3: Software Licenses- The SQLite source code is in the public domain, and is free for use by anyone and for any purpose. No license is required. However, some users desire a license so that they can have warranty of title, or just because their company lawyers say they need one. A perpetual license and warranty of title for the core SQLite source code is available for this purpose. The SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE), the ZIPVFS Extension, and the Compressed and Encrypted ReadOnly Database (CEROD) extension are enhanced versions of SQLite that handle encrypted and/or compressed databases. SEE can read and write encrypted databases. SEE encrypts all database content, including metadata, so that the database file appears as white noise. ZIPVFS compresses the database on-the-fly using application-supplied compression and decompression functions. CEROD reads a compressed database that is also optionally encrypted. All of SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are supplied in source code form only; the licensee is responsible for compiling the products for their chosen platform. It is not difficult to compile any of these extension. All products come in the form of an amalgamated source file named "sqlite3.c". So compiling SEE, ZIPVFS, or CEROD into an application is simply a matter of substituting the SEE-, ZIPVFS-, or CEROD-enabled sqlite3.c source file in place of the public-domain sqlite3.c source file and recompiling. Licenses for SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are perpetual. All three extension can read and write ordinary, uncompressed and unencrypted database files.

\n 12) Chardet: GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] 			 Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an {}""".format(first,second)
